I'm Johnny, aka LostMyPillow.

I'm a self taught developer, I build stuff ranging from simple **HTML** websites:

- [My own personal website](https://github.com/lostmypillow/lostmypillow.github.io)

...to simple **React** frontends:

- [Dancing Goats (Abandoned)](https://github.com/lostmypillow/dancinggoats), a website I made for a local eponymous coffee shop.

...and combining **React** or **Vue** frontends with **Django or FastAPI (Python)** backends:

- [JRAR](https://github.com/lostmypillow/jrar), a school project that combines a Raspberry Pi and Arduino with a Django backend and a React frontend.
- [JCourses(WIP)](https://github.com/lostmypillow/jcourses-fastapi), a FastAPI ([formerly Django](https://github.com/lostmypillow/jcourses)) API that scrapes course data drom my university, NTUT. A frontend for it is a work in progress.
- [JSearch](https://github.com/lostmypillow/jsearch), a FastAPI server that consumes an OMDb API and a random RapidAPI that returns movie or Google resultsto a Nuxt frontend.

Recently I'm working on **Express + React** projects:
 - [JQuotes (WIP)](https://github.com/lostmypillow/jquotes), a work in progress quotes generator with login and "favorites" functionalities
 - [JDMS (WIP)](https://github.com/lostmypillow/jDMS), my attempt to automate my daily assignment at the PR firm I'm interning at. It's the biggest project of all my projects.

...as well as learning **Java** via [HelloJava](https://github.com/lostmypillow/HelloJava) and **Expo (React Native)** via [HelloExpo](https://github.com/lostmypillow/HelloExpo)

I host my personal website and several frontend only projects with GitHub Pages, and use Render to host the backup backends.
