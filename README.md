# Heeeere's Johnny!

I'm Johnny, aka LostMyPillow.

[my personal website](https://www.lostmypillow.duckdns.org)

I'm a self taught web dev, building **Django (Python)** and **FastAPI (Python)** web apps that serve **React**, **Vue** and static HTML frontends. 


I self-host those sites on my RPi 3B+ with **Docker containers**, including this very site.


I'm learning **Java** for future Spring Boot projects and **Expo (React Native)** for my foray into cross platform mobile app development.
