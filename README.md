# Heeeere's Johnny!

I'm Johnny, aka LostMyPillow.

[my personal website](https://www.lostmypillow.duckdns.org)

I'm building:
- **Django (Python)** web apps serving **React/Vue** frontends


I'm self-hosting those apps with:
- **Docker** containers on my **RPi 3B+** in my own home, behind an **NGINX reverse proxy**
- ...with the exception of my own personal site, which is hosted on my RPi, Cloudflare Pages and GitHub Pages at tge same time, and "Dancing Goats", a work-in-progress hosted on Vercel (for now).


I'm learning: 
- **Java** for future Spring Boot projects
- **Rust** for systems programming
- **NTLK(Natural Language Toolkit)** just for fun
