# Heeeere's Johnny!

I'm Johnny, aka LostMyPillow.

I'm a self taught developer, I build stuff ranging from simple **HTML** websites:

- [My own personal website](https://github.com/lostmypillow/lostmypillow.github.io)

...to simple **React** frontends:

- [Dancing Goats](https://github.com/lostmypillow/dancinggoats), a website I made for a local eponymous coffee shop.

...and combining **React** or **Vue** frontends with **Django or FastAPI (Python)** backends:

- [JRAR](https://github.com/lostmypillow/jrar), a school project that combines a Raspberry Pi and Arduino with a Django backend and a React frontend.
- [JCourses](https://github.com/lostmypillow/jcourses), a Django API that scrapes course data drom my university, NTUT. A frontend for it is in the works.
- [JSearch](https://github.com/lostmypillow/jsearch), a FastAPI server that consumes an OMDb API and a random RapidAPI that returns movie or Google resultsto a Nuxt frontend.

Recently I'm working on **Express + React** projects:
 - [JQuotes](https://github.com/lostmypillow/jquotes), a work in progress quotes generator with login and "favorites" functionalities
 - [JDMS](https://github.com/lostmypillow/jDMS), my attempt to automate my daily assignment at the PR firm I'm interning at

...as well as learning **Java** via [HelloJava](https://github.com/lostmypillow/HelloJava) and **Expo (React Native)** via [HelloExpo](https://github.com/lostmypillow/HelloExpo)

I self-host all of the above projects (frontend and backend) and future projects on my RPi 3B+ at home, using **Docker containers**. They're behind an **nginx reverse proxy** and a DuckDNS free domain.

For backup, I host my personal website and several frontend only projects with GitHub Pages, and use Render to host the backup backends.
