# Heeeere's Johnny!

I'm Johnny, aka LostMyPillow.

I'm a self taught developer, I build stuff ranging from simple **HTML** websites:

- [My own personal website, styled with Pico CSS](https://github.com/lostmypillow/lostmypillow.github.io)

...to simple **React** frontends:

- [Dancing Goats, a website I made for a local eponymous coffee shop](https://github.com/lostmypillow/dancinggoats)

...and combining **React** or **Vue** frontends with **Django or FastAPI (Python)** backends:

- [JRAR, a school project that combines a Raspberry Pi and Arduino with a Django backend and a React frontend](https://github.com/lostmypillow/jrar)
- [JCourses, a Django and React combo that scrapes course data drom my university, NTUT, and displays them in a more sensible manner](https://github.com/lostmypillow/jcourses)
- [JSearch, a Vue frontend that displays data from a FastAPI server, which in turn consumes an OMDb API and a random RapidAPI that returns Google results](https://github.com/lostmypillow/jsearch)

Recently I'm working on an **Express + React** project [JQuotes, a work in progress quotes generator with login and "favorites" functionalities](https://github.com/lostmypillow/jquotes)

...as well as learning **Java** via [HelloJava](https://github.com/lostmypillow/HelloJava) and **Expo (React Native)** via [HelloExpo](https://github.com/lostmypillow/HelloExpo)

I self-host all of the above projects (frontend and backend) and future projects on my RPi 3B+ at home, using **Docker containers**. They're behind an **nginx reverse proxy** and a DuckDNS free domain.

For backup, I host my personal website and several frontend only projects with GitHub Pages, and use Render to host the backup backends.
