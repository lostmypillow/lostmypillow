# Heeeere's Johnny!

I'm Johnny, aka LostMyPillow.

[my personal website](https://www.lostmypillow.duckdns.org)

I'm a self taught developer, I build stuff ranging from simple HTML websites:

- [My own personal website, styled with Pico CSS](https://github.com/lostmypillow/lostmypillow.github.io)

...to simple **React** frontends:

- [Dancing Goats, a website I made for a local eponymous coffee shop](https://github.com/lostmypillow/dancinggoats)

...and combining React or Vue frontends with Django or FastAPI (Python) backends:

- [JRAR, a school project that combines a Raspberry Pi and Arduino with a Django backend and a React frontend](https://github.com/lostmypillow/jrar)
- [JCourses, a Django and React combo that scrapes course data drom my university, NTUT, and displays them in a more sensible manner](https://github.com/lostmypillow/jcourses)
- 
 **Django (Python)** and **FastAPI (Python)** web apps that serve **React**, **Vue** and static HTML frontends. 


I self-host those sites on my RPi 3B+ with **Docker containers**, including this very site.


I'm learning **Java** for future Spring Boot projects and **Expo (React Native)** for my foray into cross platform mobile app development.
